# Enhancing Postnatal Care through Predictive Analytics and Targeted Community Interventions

## Introduction: Tackling PNC Challenges with Data-Driven Solutions

In Kenya, the gap in efficient and effective Postnatal Care (PNC) remains a significant public health concern. This project leverages advanced data analytics and targeted community health worker (CHW) interventions to bridge these gaps.

### The Core Problem

- A key challenge in PNC delivery is predicting Expected Dates of Delivery (EDD) and identifying women at high risk of missing critical PNC visits.

### Our Approach: Leveraging Data Science for Enhanced PNC

- Utilizing Antenatal Care (ANC) data, we developed predictive models to forecast EDD, estimate the likelihood of low PNC visits, and empower CHWs with a data-driven recommendation system.

## Project Objectives and Strategies

1. **Predictive Modelling for EDD**: Development of an algorithm using ANC data to aid in proactive planning for PNC.
2. **Estimating PNC Visit Likelihood**: Identification of women at risk of low PNC visits for early interventions.
3. **Community Health Worker Recommendation System**: Implementation of a system for prioritizing CHW visits.
4. **Impact Assessment**: Monitoring the effectiveness of interventions in improving PNC uptake and outcomes.

## Data Utilization

- Utilizing ANC, demographic, geographic, economic, and outcome tracking data, we aimed to address accessibility and affordability barriers and assess our interventions' accuracy and effectiveness.

## Interpretation of Findings and Important Features for Predicting EDD

### Overview

- The project utilized data science methodologies to predict EDD, essential for enhancing PNC.

### Key Findings

1. **Age as a Dominant Feature**
2. **Health Conditions and EDD**
3. **Multiples**
4. **Economic and Geographic Factors**

### Insights from Residual Visualizations

- Residual plots and the distribution of residuals indicated the model's efficacy in estimating days to delivery.

### Implications for Community Health Workers

- Targeted interventions, personalized counseling, efficient resource allocation, and empowerment through technology.

### Bridging the PNC Gap

- Leveraging model insights to bridge the PNC gap, especially in the immediate post-delivery phase.

## Concluding Section: Recommendation System Results

### Overview

- Successful implementation of a recommendation system using the XGBoost model.

### Key Findings

- The model generated a prioritized list of expectant mothers based on EDD and the probability of low PNC visits.

### Top Recommendations

- Identifying individuals with high probabilities of low PNC visits, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

### Implications for Community Health Workers

- The system enables a proactive approach and efficient resource allocation.

### Moving Forward

- Continuous improvement, further analysis, and wider implementation of the system.

### Conclusion

- This data-driven recommendation system marks a significant advancement in PNC visit rates, aiming to impact maternal and infant health outcomes positively.

## Next Steps

- **Model Refinement and Updating**: Continuously improve and update the model with new data.
- **Expansion and Scalability**: Explore the potential for wider implementation across various regions.
- **Further Research and Development**: Investigate additional variables and modeling techniques to enhance accuracy and effectiveness.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborate with healthcare professionals, policy makers, and community leaders to maximize the impact.

By integrating predictive analytics with community health strategies, this project aims to transform PNC delivery in Kenya, ensuring timely, accurate, and effective care for mothers and newborns.
